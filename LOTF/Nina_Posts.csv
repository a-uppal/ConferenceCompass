W1,Proxy Problem,"I'm prepping for #LotF2026 and thinking about Hans Clevers' upcoming talk on rewriting rules. One rule we must break: using demographic proxies for biology. This is South (Contextual Validity) on the Data Compass—and it's the most ignored direction. If you aren't looking South, you aren't predicting biology; you're predicting healthcare access.",Anuj/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W2,Ontology & Silos,"Automation is useless if the robots don't speak the same language. If you're attending Sam Michael's (GSK) session on automation, ask: Are we building data silos at high speed? We need East (Semantic Clarity) to fix this. #FAIRData #Ontology",Anuj/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W3,Semantic Clarity,Looking forward to Julia Fox's (Takeda) talk on Semantic Tools. We can't have AI 'reason' if data lacks definitions. This is East on the Compass. Level 1 is a match. Level 3 is inference. Where is your lab?,Anuj/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W4,Automating Fairness,"Humans can't check millions of rows for bias. Algorithms can. I'll be showing how we calculate Shannon entropy for demographic representation (that's North (Statistical Health) on the Data Compass, specifically the Bias Risk component of ML Readiness) on the fly. Catch me after Yves Fomekong Nanfack's session.",Anuj/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W5,Science Deep Dive,"I'm bringing our full ontology mapping demo to Boston. If you want to see how we map raw instrument data to HGNC/UniProt automatically, find me. It's magic for data scientists.",Anuj/Ben to comment within 2 hours,

W7,Monday,The Science Standout,"The session that will stick with me from #LotF2026: Julia Fox's talk on Semantic Tools for Drug Discovery. She articulated something I've been saying for years: you can't build AI that ""reasons"" if your data doesn't have definitions. This is East on the Data Compass—Semantic Clarity. Most orgs treat ontology mapping as a nice-to-have. It's actually the difference between AI that correlates and AI that understands. If you're working on semantic infrastructure for life sciences data, I'd love to connect. #FAIRData #Ontology #LotF2026",Julia Fox session photo or Ontology slide (Page 13-14)
W7,Wednesday,Technical Deep Dive,"At #LotF2026, I got the question I was hoping for: ""How do you actually measure if data is ML-ready? What's the math?"" Short version: Data Sufficiency (Factor 50 Rule, power analysis, class balance), Bias Risk (Shannon entropy, CDD divergence, proxy detection), Feature Quality (Theil's U, R-value, VIF). This isn't a black box. It's peer-reviewed methodology (AIDRIN framework, SSDBM 2024). DM me for the full technical breakdown. #MLReadiness #DataScience #AIReadyData",Slide 40 (ML Readiness Assessment)
W7,Friday,Community Builder,"One of the best parts of #LotF2026: finding my people. Data scientists and informaticians who care about FAIR principles beyond checkboxes, ontology infrastructure that actually works, bias detection before it becomes a regulatory problem, making AI trustworthy not just powerful. I'm starting a monthly ""AI Readiness"" virtual coffee chat. First session: February. Topic: ""Measuring Semantic Interoperability—What Works and What Doesn't."" Comment ""interested"" if you want an invite. #FAIRData #DataScience #AIReadyData",AI Readiness Coffee Chat - February graphic
