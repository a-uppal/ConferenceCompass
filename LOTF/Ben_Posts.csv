W1,Networking Hook,Reviewing the #LotF2026 agenda. Huge lineup from Takeda and Roche. I'm looking to speak with leaders who are tired of their AI pilots stalling because they lack a navigation system for their data. Who is going to be in Boston?,Anuj/Nina to comment within 2 hours,
W2,Table Stakes Rant,"Unpopular opinion: 'Data Governance' has become a boring compliance checkbox. It needs to be an engineering constraint. This is West (Governance) on our compass—it protects the whole journey. If you want to see what active governance looks like, find me at #LotF.",Anuj/Nina to comment within 2 hours,
W3,Execution Risk,"70% of data initiatives fail. It's usually people, not tech. I'm heading to Boston to talk about the 'Execution' side of the equation. DM me if you want to see our readiness scorecard.",Anuj/Nina to comment within 2 hours,
W4,Calendar Drop,"My calendar for Boston is filling up. I have 4 slots left for anyone who wants a 15-minute 'Readiness Audit' of their current strategy. First come, first served.",Anuj/Nina to comment within 2 hours,

W7,Monday,Connector Gratitude,"31 conversations. 14 demo requests. 1 incredible week. Thank you to everyone who made time for us at #LotF2026. What struck me most: the hunger for a clear answer to ""is our data actually AI-ready?"" Not ""is it clean?"" Not ""is it cataloged?"" But: ""Can we confidently build on this?"" If we spoke in Boston and you want that 15-minute Readiness Audit we discussed—my calendar is open. Link in comments. To the Data Compass team (Anuj, Nina)—proud to build this with you. #DataCompass #AIReadyData",Networking collage or booth photo
