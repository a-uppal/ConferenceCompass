W1,The $5M Mistake,"We spend millions on 'Clean Data'—no duplicates, right formats. Yet 87% of AI projects fail. Why? Because Clean ≠ Ready. Clean is a spreadsheet. Ready is a Compass. We need to navigate 4 dimensions, not just one. If you're going to #LabOfTheFuture, ask yourself: is your data ready, or just clean?",Nina/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W2,Asset vs Execution,"Most failures I see happen in the top-left quadrant: High Asset Maturity (great data), Low Execution Readiness (resistant teams). We need to measure both. Excited to discuss the full equation in Boston.",Nina/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W3,The 4 Dimensions,We need a compass for AI readiness. North: Statistical Health. East: Semantic Clarity. South: Contextual Validity. West: Governance & Safety. Which direction is your organization ignoring? #AIReadiness,Nina/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W4,Soft Launch,We've been working on something that automates the 'Ready' assessment across all 4 dimensions. It's called Data Compass. We'll be demoing how it solves the Proxy Problem live in Boston. #DataCompass #Launch,Nina/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W5,Speaker Challenge,"I challenge every speaker at #LotF to answer one question: How do you measure North (Statistical Health)? Is your data learning-ready, or just filled out? Looking at you Christopher Arendt and Amrik Mahal—can't wait to hear your take!",Nina/Ben to comment within 2 hours,
W6,Live Reaction,Slide from Nicole Crane confirms it: Tech stack and Talent stack are misaligned. This is exactly why we built the Execution Readiness score.,Nina/Ben to comment within 2 hours,

W7,Monday,The Reflection Post,"Back from #LotF2026 and still processing. The theme I heard in nearly every conversation: ""We have the data. We have the AI tools. We don't have confidence they'll work together."" Three things I'll be thinking about for weeks: 1) The gap between ""clean"" and ""ready"" is wider than most orgs realize 2) Organizational readiness fails more projects than technical debt 3) The industry is hungry for a standard—not another dashboard. Thank you to everyone who stopped by our demo. If we connected in Boston and I owe you a follow-up—it's coming this week. #AIReadyData #DataCompass",Team photo at conference
W7,Wednesday,Insight Thread (5 Learnings),"5 things I learned at #LotF2026: 1) The ""Tech Stack vs Talent Stack"" gap is real (Nicole Crane nailed it) 2) Autonomous labs need autonomous quality control (Petrina Kamya's vision) 3) CMC is the next frontier for AI readiness 4) Semantic interoperability is non-negotiable 5) The industry wants a standard, not another tool. We're listening. More to share soon. What was your biggest takeaway? #LotF2026",5 Learnings from #LotF2026 graphic
W7,Friday,Challenge Recap,"Before #LotF2026, I challenged speakers to answer: ""How do you measure Statistical Health (North)?"" Here's what I heard: Some orgs measure it manually, per project, without standardization. Many measure Data Quality but NOT ML Readiness. Almost no one has a portfolio-level view. The gap is clear. The opportunity is massive. To Christopher Arendt, Amrik Mahal, and everyone who engaged: thank you. Your answers are shaping our roadmap. #LotF2026 #DataCompass #AIReadyData",Challenge question graphic or session photo
