Week 1,Tue,Anuj,The $5M Mistake,"We spend millions on 'Clean Data'—no duplicates, right formats. Yet 87% of AI projects fail. Why? Because Clean ? Ready. Clean is a spreadsheet. Ready is a Compass. We need to navigate 4 dimensions, not just one. If you're going to #LabOfTheFuture, ask yourself: is your data ready, or just clean?",Text Only,Draft,,,,,,,,
Week 1,Wed,Nina,The Proxy Problem,"I'm prepping for #LotF2026 and thinking about Hans Clevers' upcoming talk on rewriting rules. One rule we must break: using demographic proxies for biology. This is South (Contextual Validity) on the Data Compass—and it's the most ignored direction. If you aren't looking South, you aren't predicting biology; you're predicting healthcare access.",Slide: The Proxy Problem (Page 19),Draft,,,,,,,,
Week 1,Thu,Ben,The Networking Hook,Reviewing the #LotF2026 agenda. Huge lineup from Takeda and Roche. I'm looking to speak with leaders who are tired of their AI pilots stalling because they lack a navigation system for their data. Who is going to be in Boston?,Photo of Conference Agenda,Draft,,,,,,,,
Week 2,Tue,Anuj,Asset vs. Execution,"Most failures I see happen in the top-left quadrant: High Asset Maturity (great data), Low Execution Readiness (resistant teams). We need to measure both. Excited to discuss the full equation in Boston.",Slide: Asset vs Execution Matrix (Page 28),Draft,,,,,,,,
Week 2,Wed,Nina,Ontology & Silos,"Automation is useless if the robots don't speak the same language. If you're attending Sam Michael's (GSK) session on automation, ask: Are we building data silos at high speed? We need East (Semantic Clarity) to fix this. #FAIRData #Ontology",Slide: Ontology Management (Page 14),Draft,,,,,,,,
Week 2,Thu,Ben,Table Stakes Rant,"Unpopular opinion: 'Data Governance' has become a boring compliance checkbox. It needs to be an engineering constraint. This is West (Governance) on our compass—it protects the whole journey. If you want to see what active governance looks like, find me at #LotF.",Text Only,Draft,,,,,,,,
