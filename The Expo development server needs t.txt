The Expo development server needs to be run in a terminal that supports its interactive UI. Since this is a shell environment, let me provide you the command to run manually:

  cd /c/Users/anuj_/OneDrive/Documents/ConferenceCompass
  npm start

  Or on Windows PowerShell:
  cd C:\Users\anuj_\OneDrive\Documents\ConferenceCompass
  npm start

  This will show you a QR code to scan with Expo Go on your phone.
